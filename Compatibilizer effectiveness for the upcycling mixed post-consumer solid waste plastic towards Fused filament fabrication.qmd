 \doublespacing In the realm of recycling, the concept of bypassing the sorting process has emerged as an intriguing solution to circumvent the high costs and inherent inefficiencies of this process.This has necessitated the blend of polymers with compatiblizers exploring novel approaches to do so. In this study, the recycled polymer blends based on recycled poly (ethylene terephthalate) (rPET) and high density polyethylene (HDPE) at 90/10 wt% with and without 10% of three type of SEBS (G-1650,G1652; C1010) was prepared in a co-rotating twin screw extruder and Fused Granular Filament printer. The effects of adding 10% SEBS and the blend characterization of both processes are showed.

<!-- Plastic advantage and  problem -->
Plastics have become an indispensable material for a wide range of applications, including beverage packaging, construction, automotive, electrical and electronic equipment, due to their exceptional properties [@maris2018a]. 
They offer unquestionable advantages such as high mechanical strength, low density, lightweight nature, ease of processing, and cost-effectiveness [@Mwanza; @Mbohwa2017].
However PSW has emerged as a major source of contamination, causing environmental concerns[@fomina2021b]. The packaging industry is particularly responsible for generating approximately 40% of the plastic waste [@balwada2021]. Remarkably, polymers such as PE, PP, and PET collectively comprise over 90% of all packaging, solidifying their position as the most extensively employed polymers within this sector. [@Geyer2021]. Although, recycling has become the predominant method for plastic waste disposal, inadequate waste management has resulted in alarming statistics. In European countries, only 32.5% of plastic is recycled, 42.6% incinerated for energy recovery, and 24.9% ends up in landfills, according to the European Parliament [European Parliament]. The situation is even more concerning in India, where a staggering 80% of plastic waste is consigned to landfills, 8% is incinerated, and only 7% is recycled [@singh2017]. The challenges encountered in plastic recycling, can be attributed to a shortage of collection infrastructure, the complexity of effectively sorting various plastic types, the high costs, and time-consuming nature of collecting and processing plastic waste [@kassab2023] [@ghosh2021]. Additionally, recycled plastics often exhibit suboptimal quality, characterized by inconsistent coloration and diminished structural strength [@kassab2023].

<!-- Compatibilization solution -->
In recent years, there has been a growing interest in recycling plastics without prior sorting as an appealing alternative to mitigate the associated cost [@mbarek2009]. One example of this trend is the initiative in Europe, which encourages keeping the bottle and cap together. Nevertheless, a primary obstacle to the successful blending of different plastics lies in their inherently lower interphase tension and lack of chemical compatibility, resulting in low-quality materials. To addres this issue, one potential strategy is to incorporate additives called compatibilizers  during the melting process. These compatibilizers facilitate  interaction between the phases of two  immiscible polymers, stabilize the morphology by reducing the drop size in the dispersed phase, and enhance the physicomechanical properties of the mixture [@fomina2021b].  Traditional methods for achieving compatibilization involve adding small quantities of components, such as  block or graft copolymers, fillers and coupling agents. This can be accomplished through either a chemical or physical process [@Maris2018]. Reactive compatibilizer establish effective connections between polymers via reactive extrusion, while the physical dispersion of the copolymer segment in the phases of the mix improves the inter-facial adhesion [@Nechifor2018]. 

Extensive analysis has been conducted on the compatibilization of different plastic waste.  Non-reactive block copolymers such as EPDM and EPM have been employed to facilitate the compatibilzation of recycled PP/PE [@bertin2002, @fang2013 @yousefi1998].  [@fortelny2004] demonstrated the effectiveness of combining these block copolymers with BS in PE/PP/PS blends, resulting in waste materials with comparable toughness to their virgin counterparts. Another  commonly investigated  block copolymer is SEBS, which hasshown remarkable efficacy in improving the properties of immiscible blends such as  HDPE/PP [@mural2011], PP/HIPS [@santana2003], and  PET/HDPE [@Iniguez2000].  [@zhang2009 @zhang2007]  conducted research showing  that the incorporation of SEBS results in a more stable and uniform morphology within the blend, while significantly enhancing the ductility of the blend when PET is combined with LDPE. Additionally, [@inoya2012a] demonstrated that the addition of 1phr  SEBS  improved the impact strength of unnotched specimens by 2.7 times  and allowed  for a reduction in drop size of approximately 50%  in blends composed of 95% rPET and 5% PP. These findings highlight the advantageous effects of SEBS as a compatibilizer in this context 

Reactive compatibilizers are  functional groups that are chemically  grafted onto polyolefins or the polymer  used in the blend. This allows the copolymer to interact with one of the phases while simultaneously reacting with the other.  These interactions result in the formation of covalent bonds, facilitated by coupling agents such as peroxide, anhydride, isocyanate and oxazoline [@ghosh202]. In the waste stream MA and GMA are commonly employed due to their compatibility with hydroxyl, carboxyl and amine functional groups [@Maris2018, @Nechifor201]. In the case of MA, it has found utillity  in grafting with various polyolefins and block copolymers, resulting in notable improvements in the mechanical properties, morphology, and rheology of blends including rABS/rPC  [@farzadfar2014],  rPA6/rPP [@hong2006, miskolczi2013], rPP/Nylon [@kim2007], and rHDPE/rPP [@atiqah2014,@fang2013a,@atiqah2015a]. Furthermore, MA has displayed effectiveness in the compatibilization of rPET with other  PSW materials, showcasting the ability to react with hydroxyl ends on PET [@Lei2009, @zander2019, @shahrajabi2019, @zhidan2011, @hellati2010, @akshaya2020, @santos2022]. On the other hand, GMA  has been  used in the compatibilization of rPET and rHDPE [@salleh2013, @akkapeddi1995, @adekunler2020] and has demonstrated greater efficiency than MA, as it can react with both carboxyl and hydroxyl ends of PET[@chen2014, @pluta2001] 


<!-- Blending methodology-->

Two commonly used techniques are employed for the compatibilization of plastic waste. The first method involves mixing various polymers with a compatibilizer using a batch mixer[@pracella2004, @araujo2018, @dobrovszkyI2016]. The resulting blend is then processed through compression molding to create test specimens. The second technique involves using an extruder to homogenize the plastic waste blend, which is subsequently injection-molded to form desired products [@Martis (2018)] . Commonly, single and double screw compounders are used for this purpose [@zhu2015, @oyman2003, @razavi2011, @kayaisang2009]. However, the utilization of direct material extrusion 3D printing for this purpose is still in its infancy. While there has been some exploration in blending recycled materials via large-scale direct 3D printing [@netto2022, @romani2023, @domingues2017], the use of compatibilizers and their efficiency  in this context remains largely uninvestigated. 

<!-- purpose of the study-->

The primary objectives of this study are to conduct a comparative analysis and evaluation of three  SEBS-based compatibilizers with two facilitating  physical compatibilization and one promoting reactive compatibilization. Additionally, the study aims to contribute to our understanding of  the feasibility of large-scale 3D printing, specifically FGF, as a novel methodology for  blending and compatibilizing PSW without prior sorting comparing with the conventional method of twin screw extrusion. Furthermore,  this research will contribute to the advancement of the distributed recycling additive manufacturing approach and the development of more durable and compatible materials for 3D printing applications.

In the context of this research, a fully  recycled water bottle was employed as a representative model. The bottle consisted of PET for the body and HDPE for the cap without  prior separation. Binary and ternary blends were then extensively analyzed  for mechanical, chemical, thermal, morphological, and rheological characterization


# Materials and Methods

## Materials 
In this study, we used post-consumers Cristaline© water bottle composed of 90% PET (body) and 10% (cap) of HDPE, collected from receptacles placed in engineering schools near the laboratory. Linear SEBS copolymer Kraton G-1650 with Brookfield viscosity of 8000 cps at 25°C and 25% of polymer concentration in toluene, linear SEBS copolymer Kraton G-1652 with Brookfield viscosity of 1800 cps at same conditions both with ~30% of polystyrene content were kindly donated by Kraton Polymers (Almere, Netherlands) and SEBS Maleated (cirKular+ c1010) ~1.5% of maleic anhydride donated by Univar solutions (France).

## Blending and sample preparation 

Prior to the blending process, the material transformation into feedstock followed the methodology used in previous research. It's noteworthy that compatibilizers were not subject to drying process. Binary blends consisting of rPET/rHDPE (90:10 w/w) and ternary blends involving  rPET/rHDPE/G1650, rPET/rHDPE/G1652 , and rPET/rHDPE/c1010 were prepared using two distinct machines. The co-rotating twin-screw extruder vertical micro-compounder (DSM xplore, Netherlands) and a modified open-source FGF printer with three heat zones (Gigabot XL re:3D, Houston, TX, USA) were employed for this purpose. In the ternary blends, the quantity of compatibilizer utilized was 10%.

For the micro-compounder, the extrusion temperatures were set at 250°C, 260°C, and 260°C, while the screw speed was maintained at 100 rpm. These temperature conditions were selected to ensure material melting without causing degradation. The passage through the extruder time was carefully measured using a chronometer and was set at 1 minute, 2.2 minutes, and 5 minutes to explore the impact of residence time on the compatibilization process. Subsequently, the extrudates were injected into the mold by an injection machine operating at 260°C, with the mold temperature held at 40°C.  Conversely, the ternary blends were directly produced through Fused Granular Fabrication (FGF) printing. The residence time during extrusion within the machine was experimentally determined to be 2.2 minutes. Detailed printing parameters can be found in Table 1 for reference

##Characterization Methods

The injected and printed samples were characterized using different methods, as summarized in table 2. Previous chemical and thermal characterization of net materials was carry out.

```
### Residence time estimation 

The residence time of the material within the printer's extruder was determined experimentally. To calculate the residence time, a small quantity of pink tracer was introduced directly into the flakes within the rotating screw during a steady-state extrusion process at a speed of 10 mm/s. The time elapsed before a noticeable color change occurred at the nozzle was carefully recorded. This procedure was conducted four times to evaluate its reproducibility and consistency. 

### Mechanical characterization 

#### Tensil test 

Binary and ternary blends tested for tensile properties according to the ISO 527-1 standard on type 1B with a Zwick/Roell 1476 machine (L.Schreiner, Germany ) load cell with capacity of 100kN. Measurements were carry out on five different specimens for each formulation with a load speed of 10mm/s. After testing, the mean values and standar error of stress, strain, and elastic modulus were calculated from stress-strain curves obtained in the test ans analyzed using Excel and Origing Pro8. 

#### Charpy test 

Printed and injected specimens were tested for impact properties according the ISO 179-1 standard on specimen 1eAb in a Instron ceast 9050 instrumented impact hammer 7.5J. Measurements were carry out on ten different specimens for each formulation chosen. Results were analysed using excel and Origing Pro8

### Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy --FTIR--

A Bruker IFS 66 spectrophotometer was used for IR measurement. Each spectrum have been recorded in the range of $4000~cm^{-1}$ to $375~cm{-1}$ in a resonance. Baseline correction, and normalization were carried out in the softawere OrigingPro 8.

### Modulated Differential scanning calorimetry --mDSC--

  Modulated differential scanning calorimetry analysis were performed with a... operating under air atmosphere at heating rate of $10~°C/min$ and cooling rate $5~°C/min \pm1. For printed and injected samples, a small section was cut from the tensile bar. Net polymers, binary and ternary blends were evaluated using three cycles: first heating from 20°C to 300 °C, cooling to 20°C and reheating to 300°C for rPET. The rHDPE sample was analyzed following similar cycles but with the minimum temperature set at -70 °C and maximum temperature set at 210°C. finally, for the binary and ternary blends with temperatures from -70 to 300°C.
The first heating was made to erase the thermal history of the sample. The measurements of net materials correspond to the second melting curve while for blends the first melting curve. 
The degree of crystallinity (Xc) was calculated from the area under the melting peaks as expressed in equation (1) [@taghavi2018; @pan2020]:

$$
X_{c}(\%) = \frac{\Delta H_{m}}{w \cdot \Delta H_{m}^\circ}
$$ {#eq-dsc}

Where, $\Delta H_{m}$ is the latent heat of melt, $w$ is weight percentage of polymer in the blend, and $\Delta H_{m}^\circ$ is the reference heat of 100% crystalline PET ($140~J/g$) and HDPE ($293~J/g$), respectively, provided in the literature [@pan2020; @kratofil2006].

### Thermogravimetric analysis --TGA--

Thermogravimetric analysis of a small section cut from the charpy bar were performed in a TGA/DSC Mettler Toledo with STARe software to determine the degradation temperature of the materials. The samples were heated from 20°C to 500°C at a rate of $10~°C/min$ under air, then hold at 500 for 58 min.

### Rheology 

The oscillatory flow measurements of complex viscosity, the storage modulus and the loss modulus of injected and printed rPET, rHDPE, and rPET90//rHDPE10 with and without compatibilization were determined in a Rheometer TA Ares system using parallel plate geometry (d=25mm, Gap=1mm) for frequencies ranging from 100 to 0.1 Hz under air atmosphere at 270°C [@kimEffectFunctionalGroup1997] for all samples and  HDPE at 170°C [@escocioRheologicalBehaviorRenewable2015].

### Scanning electron microscope --SEM--

In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the morphological characteristics of the blend, samples underwent a Soxhlet extraction test to isolate the minor phase (High-Density Polyethylene, HDPE) within the blend. Samples intended for Charpy impact testing were fractured under cryogenic conditions using liquid nitrogen, followed by dissolution in Xylene for a period of 14 hours at a temperature approximately 380°C. To facilitate enhanced observation, these samples were further prepared by sputter-coating with a thin layer of platinum. The examination of the samples was conducted using scanning electron microscopy equipment (Hitachi model SU1000), with an operating acceleration voltage of 5 kV.

Quantitative analysis of the obtained images was performed using python software to assess the homogenization of the blend.

# Results and discussion 
The results and discussion section are organized as follow: first a macroscopic analysis of the mechanical properties of the blends followed by a microscopic evaluation. 
## Mechanical analysis --Tensile test-- 

Within the framework of the compatibilization process, specifically in the realm of reactive extrusion, the temporal extent of the reaction is intricately connected to the duration necessary of the material to traverse the extruder [@gao199]. To evaluate the potential impact of residence time on the mechanical properties of the binary and ternary blends, a study was conducted utilizing  a micro-compounder. Three specific residence intervals were investigated: 1 minute, 5 minutes, and 2.2 minutes Mean results of the mechanical properties are shown in table 3.

![Tensile Strength of injected samples with A) One minute B) two minutes C) five minutes residence time](figures/Fig_1_Tensile_strength.png){#fig-1 width="90%"}

- In general, in the absence of compatibilizer, specimens consistently demostrated maximum tensile strength, regardless of the residence duration, with mean values of 51.3, 47, and 49.1 MPa for one, two, and five minutes, respectively (refer to Table 3).

- Furthermore, when considering the entire set of samples, samples treated with 1650 as compatibilizer exhibited the lowest tensile strength and a more widely dispersed results,except for 1 min residence time displaying 10.5% more than reactive compatibizer.

- In the study, it was seen that the performance of the 1652 sample was generally superior, with the exception of a specific instance (2 min) where it showed similar results (37.2 +-12.8 MPa)to the reactive compatibilizer at 38.1 +- 3.1 MPa (as indicated in Table 3). Notably, at the five-minute mark, 1652 exhibited a 17.75% higher tensile strength than the reactive compatibilizer, however with increased variability (refer to Table 3).

- Samples treated with the reactive compatibilizer c1010 did not display significant alterations in strength when the duration of time was modified, maintaining a median strength value of 37.4 ± 1.5 MPa and these specimens did not exhibit rupture in response to compatibilization. [@Fig-1]



![Young's Modulus of injected samples with A) One minute B) two minutes C) five minutes residence time](figures/Fig_2_Young's Modulus.png){#fig-2 width="90%"}
- In average, the incorporation of SEBS into the specimens led to a reduction in the Young's modulus, with a decrease of approximately 23 ± 6.4% compared to the non-compatibilized counterparts. The observed drop in modulus is indicative of a softer material property, which aligns with the rubber-like nature of SEBS. 

The tensile test and Young's modulus follow a similar pattern, as depicted in [@Fig-2]. However, Young's modulus displayed minimal variation across all time periods. On average, 1650 and 1010 demonstrated similar results, suggesting comparable levels of Young's modulus. In contrast, 1652 exhibited a significant increase in rigidity, showing a notable 15% rise in Young's modulus.


![Tensile toughness of injected samples with A) One minute B) two minutes C) five minutes residence time](figures/Fig_3_Tensile_toughness.png){#fig-3 width="90%"}
- Although samples without compatibilizers exhibit higher tensile strength and rigidity, an examination of tensile toughness [@Fig-3] reveals that non-compatibilized specimens and those treated with 1650 experienced immediate rupture and lacked plastic deformation. contrary to 1652 and 1010 samples, that exhibited plastic deformation without rupture excepting for 1652 at 2.2 min where all the samples. this depected the brittle-ductil transition caused by the addition of reactive SEBS and MA 

-Moreover, the 1010-treated samples exhibited substantially higher deformations at specific time intervals – a 1354.4% increase at 1 min, 2205.06% increase at 2.2 minutes and a 422.6% increase at 5 minutes compared to the non-compatibilized specimens.

Based on the findings, it can be concluded that the projected impact of material blending time on the mechanical properties of the samples was not substantial. However, the inclusion of compatibilizers had a more noticeable effect. 

In order to conduct a comparative analysis between the conventional blending method and the novel direct printing technique, the injected samples with a residence time of 2.2 minutes were compared with the printed samples that were subjected to the same residence time, as determined using experimental means.The experimental analysis utilized a pink tracer to measure the duration during which the material traversed the extruder in the 3D printer. Specific time intervals were selected explicitly for the comparison of the two technologies. The results are depicted in  [@Fig-4]

![A) Tensile Strength, B) Young's Modulus, C) Tensile Toughness of  Printing and Injected samples with 2.2 min residence time ](figures/Fig_4_PrintvsInj.png){#fig-4 width="90%"}
- The injected samples demonstrated a notable increase in both tensile strength and Young's modulus, exhibiting enhancements ranging between 35% to 50% and 5% to 14%, respectively, when compared to the printed samples.

- Based on the tensile toughness, it's evident that most samples experienced immediate rupture, except for those treated with 1652 and 1010 compatibilizers. Interestingly, in the printed samples, rupture occurred immediately regardless of the added compatibilizer, indicating a need for improved processes or parameters.


## Mechanical analysis --Charpy test-- 

To gain deeper insights into the mechanical properties, Charpy tests were conducted on binary and ternary blends comprising both printed and injected samples

![Impact test of Printing and Injected samples with 2.2 min residence time ](figures/Fig_5_Impact_strength.png){#fig-5 width="90%"}
The impact strength results (table 3)indicate variability based on the type of compatibilizer used and there are notable differences between the printed and injected samples.

-Among the printed samples, the impact strength consistently increased with the addition of different compatibilizers, with C1010 exhibiting the highest average impact strength of 1.5 ± 0.6 KJ/m^2, albeit with higher variation. 

- Comparing the injected specimens to the printed ones, it's intriguing to note a less consistent trend. G1652 showed the highest impact strength at 1.1 ± 0.4 KJ/m^2, whereas C1010 displayed less variation in results.

-Notably, the highest impact strength observed in the printed samples is approximately 36.56% higher than the highest impact strength in the injected samples.

-Among the overall results of the printed specimens, the inclusion of C1010 demonstrated a remarkable increase of 123.65% compared to the non-compatibilized sample. Conversely, the impact of the type of compatibilizer used was not significantly influential in the injected samples. 


Regarless the variation and inconsistencies in the results of the mechanical tests, it's evident that compatibilizers 1652 and C1010 were notably effective. The disparity observed among compatibilizers can be attributed to specific factors.

The higher mobility of g-1652 polymer chains, owing to its lower molar mass, facilitated a more effective dispersion of HDPE in PET. This improved the mechanical properties by enhancing the interfacial interaction between the materials. Conversely, MA in C1010 enabled the reaction between the hydroxyl ends of the PET molecules, leading to an enhancement in the mechanical properties.

In essence, the distinct mechanisms of action—enhanced dispersion and chemical interaction—underlie the effectiveness of g-1652 and C1010, respectively, in improving the mechanical properties of the blend of injected samples.The di,inished propertis observed in the printing samples can be attributed to several factors, including the limitations inherent in the single-screw system [Look for ref], inadequate mixing time[], suboptimal printing parameters[], and inherent constrains of the 3D printing process[]

#conclusion and future work

This study reflects the importance of use compatibilizers in the direct printing process to determinate the feasibility and scalability of this approach enhance the mechanical properties of the blend material and lowering its interphase tension. 

To further advance the use of compatibilizers in 3D printing with recycled plastics, researchers may need to explore different types of compatibilizers, evaluate their effects on the properties of printed objects, and develop guidelines for optimizing the recycling and printing process. Additionally, as this technology evolves, it will be important to conduct more studies to assess the environmental impact and cost-effectiveness of these methods.
The challenges in using compatibilizers for 3D printing with recycled plastics include ensuring good adhesion between layers, preventing degradation of the materials during extrusion and printing, and optimizing the mechanical properties of the final printed objects. Research in this area is ongoing as the 3D printing industry seeks more sustainable and eco-friendly materials for additive manufacturing.

The use of FGF for upcycling solid waste plastic is an interesting method, as it suggests a potential solution to the plastic accumulation in landfills and environment.
